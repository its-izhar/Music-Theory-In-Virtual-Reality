  "body": "# Description & Motivation\r\nWhen was the last time you went to a music concert in an huge auditorium and realized that your seat location in the hall actually was making a significant difference to the sound you were listening to?\r\nWhen was the last time you tried to feel what each instrument's importance is when you listen to a song?\r\nWhat was the last time you listened to your favorite song and remember exactly what each piece of instrument brings the \"vibe\" to the whole music experience?\r\nIf you are unsure about your answer, then it's the time!\r\n\r\nAccording to the statistics, [The Average American Listens to Four Hours of Music Each Day](http://www.spin.com/2014/06/average-american-listening-habits-four-hours-audio-day/). This was our motivation to bring this experience in Virtual Reality! After this experience, the user will have a significant insight into the data (Music & Acoustics Experience inside and outside a concert hall - and that's why the name 'Music Theory').\r\n\r\nThis immersive VR experience can be deployed to Google Cardboard or Oculus Rift. It is developed using Unity 3D Gaming Engine. This project was developed as a class project for the Virtual Reality (CIS6930) class at University of Florida.\r\nThe team consists of 3 graduate students:\r\n\r\n1. Izhar Shaikh (https://github.com/its-izhar)\r\n\r\n2. Salim Chaouqi (https://github.com/Salimchaouqi)\r\n\r\n3. Kannabiran Maheswaran (https://github.com/KannaNoob)",
