<p>When was the last time you went to a music concert in an huge auditorium and realized that your seat location in the hall actually was making a significant difference to the sound you were listening to?<br>
When was the last time you tried to feel what each instrument's importance is when you listen to a song?<br>
What was the last time you listened to your favorite song and remember exactly what each piece of instrument brings the "vibe" to the whole music experience?<br>
<strong>If you are unsure about your answer, then it's the time!</strong></p>

<p>According to the statistics, <a href="http://www.spin.com/2014/06/average-american-listening-habits-four-hours-audio-day/">The Average American Listens to Four Hours of Music Each Day</a>. This was our motivation to bring this experience in Virtual Reality!<br>
<strong>After this experience, the user will have a significant insight into the following data:  **
**1. Music &amp; Acoustics Experience inside and outside a concert hall.</strong>
<strong>2. Every single instrument's contribution to a song and overall musical experience.</strong></p>

<p>This immersive VR experience can be deployed to Google Cardboard or Oculus Rift. It is developed using Unity 3D Gaming Engine. This project was developed as a class project for the Virtual Reality (CIS6930) class at University of Florida.
The team consists of 3 graduate students:</p>
