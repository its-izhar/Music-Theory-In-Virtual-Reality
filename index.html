<p>When was the last time you went to a music concert in an huge auditorium and realized that your seat location in the hall actually was making a significant difference to the sound you were listening to?<br>
When was the last time you tried to feel what each instrument's importance is when you listen to a song?<br>
What was the last time you listened to your favorite song and remember exactly what each piece of instrument brings the "vibe" to the whole music experience?<br>
<strong>If you are unsure about your answer, then it's the time!</strong></p>

<p>According to the statistics, <a href="http://www.spin.com/2014/06/average-american-listening-habits-four-hours-audio-day/">The Average American Listens to Four Hours of Music Each Day</a>. This was our motivation to bring this experience in Virtual Reality!<br>
After this experience, the user will have a significant insight into the following data:<br>
1. Music and Acoustics Experience inside and outside a concert hall.<br>
2. Every single instrument's contribution to a song and overall musical experience.</p>

<p>This immersive VR experience can be deployed to Google Cardboard and/or Oculus Rift. It has been developed using Unity3D Gaming Engine. This project was developed as a class project for the Virtual Reality (CIS6930) class at University of Florida.
The team consists of 3 graduate students:</p>

<p>We had two major insights that we wanted to user to take from this VR experience:  </p>

<p><strong>1. The first objective was to let user know what does a concert hall bring to the sound of a musical performance.</strong><br>
This is of course determined by the acoustics of the concert hall. An insight we wanted people to have is that in front of the stage in a concert hall is the location where all the sound reflections re-converge creating a very muddy, and very echoey sound.  </p>

<p><strong>2. The Second objective was to allow the user to see what each musical instrument brings to the sound of the song.</strong><br>
This is determined by the change in the sound of the song as the user enables/disables a particular instrument (similar to "a conductor" in an orchestra). A very interesting part you will notice is that in the song 'Never going to give you' up by Rick Astetly, the electric guitar part has much less of a significant roll then in the song 'In the end' by Linkin park, which has an essential electric guitar part. An interesting fact we would like users to notice is that 'Never gonna give you up' could be considered a Pop song, whereas 'In the end' is a Rock song, which sparks an interesting correlation depending on genre.</p>
